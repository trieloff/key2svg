# key2svg

Command line tools to convert Keynote slides to SVG. You can think of it as a "print-to-SVG" script, so it does not create animated SVGs, just plain static SVGs.

## Prerequisites

You will need Apple Keynote, Ghostscript, pdfseparate, Poppler, coreutils, and Inkscape to run this script. Inkscape requires XQuartz.

```bash
$ brew install --cask xquartz
$ brew install homebrew/cask/inkscape
$ brew install ghostscript poppler coreutils
```

## Installation

Check out this repository and make the `key2svg.sh` executable

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trieloff/key2svg.git
$ cd key2svg
$ chmod +x key2svg.sh
```

## Usage

Run the script and pass the path to a Keynote file as the first command line argument.

```bash
$ ./key2svg.sh /path/to/your/keynote.key
```
